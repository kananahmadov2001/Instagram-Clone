# Instagram Clone Project
This project is a simplified clone of Instagram, designed as a front-end web development exercise. The goal of the project was to enhance skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design while implementing UI components similar to Instagram's interface.

## Main Features
* Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
* Navigation Bar: A sticky header that includes the Instagram logo, a search box, and navigation icons. The search bar changes background color when focused.
* Posts Section: A feed of posts with images, like and comment icons, and a comment box. Each post includes user interaction elements such as likes and comments.
* Stories Section: An Instagram-like stories section with horizontally scrolling story icons. On smaller screens, the stories section is aligned with the posts section for consistency.
* Suggestions Section: A horizontally scrollable box of user suggestions to follow, with follow buttons and interactive elements. The design is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
